Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.-software engineering is an approach to designing,testing and deploying and maintaining software application
importance
1.ensure high quality software-when following each design high quality applications are developed
2.enghance productivity-different methodologies help developers work faster
3.reduce cost-efficient resource utilization minimize cost
4.help ensure reliability-the applications developed are of high quality hence highly reliable


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.-1.Birth of Software Engineering at the nato software engineering confrence to handle software challanges in 1968
2.Structured Programming Edsger Dijkstra, introduced concepts like modularization, control structures (loops, conditionals), and code readability in around 1970
3.The Emergence of Agile Methodologies Agile Manifesto introduced flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development over rigid processesing 2001


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.-1.planning-Defines project scope, objectives, budget, and timeline.
2.requirement analysis-Gathers and documents user and system requirements.
3.system design-creates system architecture
4.implementation-this is actual coding according to design
5.testing-this is checking if the software applications functions effectively
6.maintainance-simply maintaing of the software


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.-Waterfall follows a sequential approach, where development progresses step by step example: Core banking systems while Agile uses an iterative approach, breaking development into small, flexible cycles called sprints example:mobile apps


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.-1.software developer-incharge of writing coding and maintaining applications
2.quality assurance engineer-they execute test case to ensure software quality
3.project manager-they oversee a project in execution and delivery


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.-ides- streamline coding by providing a unified environment that have features like code editing and debugging example vs code while version control systems  helps track code changes, collaborate efficiently, and manage different versions of a project example is GIT


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.-Debugging-one can use debugging tools to identify the bugs
complex code bases-use of modular designs and coding principle to manage effectively
workload and burnout-set boundaries and healthy work life balance
time deadline-break task into smaller task help meeting deadlines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.-1.Unit Testing – Developers test single functions or modules to make sure they behave as expected. It helps catch bugs early before they spread.
2.Integration Testing – Here, we check if different parts of the software work well together.This ensures data flows correctly between components and prevents unexpected issues.
3.System Testing –  The entire software is checked as a whole to make sure everything functions as intended.
4.Acceptance Testing – The final check before releasing the software. It’s done to confirm that the software meets the user's needs and expectations. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.-prompt engineering is when you craft and give clear instructions to AI to get perfect response

importance
1.Better Accuracy – Well structured prompts lead to more precise AI responses.
2.Saves Time – Clear instructions mean less error hence saving time.
3.Controls Output – help one to get response according to wish
4.Reduces Misinterpretation – Prevents unclear or biased responses


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-vague-"tell me about farming" improved-"explain different and most effective farming techniques and the factors that influence farming"
1. it is more clear
2.it is more specific
